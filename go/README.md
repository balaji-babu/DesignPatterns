## Introduction:
* Design Pattern is a well described solution for a common software problems. Its a blueprint that can be customized to solve a particular design problem in code.
* Design Patterns are divided into three categories
  * Creational 
  * Structural
  * Behavioral

## Creational Design Pattern:
> Deals with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a suitable manner. The basic form of object creation could result in a design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solves this problem by controlling the object creation.
* Types:
  * Singleton Pattern
  * Factory Patten 
  * Abstract Factory Pattern
  * Builder Pattern
  * Prototype Pattern

## Structural Design Pattern:
> Deals with designing by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities. Using inheritance and composition to create a large object from small objects.
* Types:
  * Adapter Pattern
  * Bridge Pattern
  * Composite Pattern
  * Decorator Pattern
  * Facade Pattern
  * Flyweight Pattern
  * Proxy Pattern

## Behavioral Design Pattern:
> Deals with better interaction between objects and to provide lose coupling and flexibility to extend easily, without breaking the code.
* Types:
  * Template Method Pattern
  * Visitor Pattern
  * Chain of Responsibility Pattern
  * Command Pattern
  * Iterator Pattern
  * Mediator Pattern
  * Memento Pattern
  * Observer Pattern
  * State Pattern
  * Strategy Pattern
