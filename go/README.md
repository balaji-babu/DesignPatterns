## DesignPatterns:
This repo contains code for SOLID design principles and design patterns in go programming language.

## How to run this code?
Go to the respective directory and run the main.go [go run main (or) go build].

## How to install golang in work environment?
Please refer to [golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) official doc.

## Introduction:
* Design patterns are typically for object oriented based languages.
* In golang we don't have Inheritance and week encapsulation, so golang is not fully object oriented.

## Solid Design Principles:
* SOLID is an acronym for five sets of principles that was first coined by "Robert C Martin"
* The Five principles of object oriented designs are:
  * SIP - Single Responsibility Principle
  * OCP - Open-Closed Principle
  * LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle
  * ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
  * DIP - Dependency Injection Principle

## Single Responsible Principle:
> A class(type: struct) should have one, and only one reason to change.
